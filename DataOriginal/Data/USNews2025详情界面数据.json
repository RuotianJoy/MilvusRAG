Some small-group instruction for undergraduates also takes place at the colleges. Most undergraduate students at the University of Cambridge are guaranteed college housing for at least three years. Many new graduate students can also utilize college housing. Around 20 percent of the student body is from outside of the European Union; tuition costs are higher for non-EU students and vary depending on the field of study. Cambridge has more than 100 libraries, including college and department libraries. The university has around 140 centers and institutes that contribute to different areas of research, such as the Centre of African Studies; the Cambridge Centre for Economic and Public Policy; and the Institute of Theoretical Geophysics. In a recent year, the university received around $415 million in research grants and contracts.",

    "summary": "The University of California—Los Angeles, commonly referred to as UCLA, is a public institution that was founded in 1919. It is one of the most applied-to universities in the U.S. Around 70 percent of the university's student body studies at the undergraduate level, and roughly 12 percent of undergraduates and more than 20 percent of graduate students at UCLA are international. Students who are not California residents must pay a supplemental tuition. UCLA guarantees three years of housing to freshman undergraduates, and some university housing is available for graduate students as well.Undergraduate studies take place across five academic divisions at UCLA: letters and science; arts and architecture; engineering and applied science; nursing; and theater, film and television. Some of the most popular majors for undergraduate students are political science, business economics and biology. Among the university’s highly ranked graduate schools are the Anderson School of Management, the David Geffen School of Medicineand theHenry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science.TheRonald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, the university’s primary teaching hospital, is a highly regarded medical facility. Most of the university’s schools use a quarter-based academic calendar, and English is the language of instruction. Since 2009-2010, the university has received an average of $1 billion for research each year. UCLA has more than 350 research labs, centers and institutes, and nearly 300 of these facilities are dedicated to medical research. Undergraduates can assist faculty with research at UCLA – and earn academic credit – by participating in the Student Research Program.",

    "summary": "The University of Toronto is a public institution that was founded in 1827. Around 80 percent of its students study at the undergraduate level. The school has three campuses – St. George, Mississauga and Scarborough – located in and around Toronto. Roughly 95 percent of the university’s graduate students study at the downtown St. George campus, as do upward of 60 percent of its undergraduates. Thousands of foreign students from more than 160 countries and regions attend the University of Toronto. In a recent year, the top countries of origin for non-Canadian students were China, India and the U.S. Tuition is higher for international students.The university comprises academic divisions focused on a range of disciplines, such as applied science and engineering, management and public health. All told, the university offers some 700 undergraduate programs and more than 200 master’s and doctoral programs. The primary language of instruction is English. The academic calendar varies between the three campuses. Student housing is available on each campus, and accommodations are guaranteed for all first-year undergraduate students. The university has more than 44 libraries that house 19 million-plus physical volumes. One major innovation that came out of the University of Toronto is insulin, which researchers discovered in the early 1920s. The university’s Banting & Best Diabetes Centre is named after two of these researchers, one of whom eventually went on to win the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for this work.",

    "summary": "The California Institute of Technology, known as Caltech, was founded in 1891 as Throop University and received its current name in 1920. The science and engineering-focused school is located in Pasadena, California, roughly 11 miles northeast of Los Angeles. There are roughly 2,200 students at Caltech, with around 55 percent of them studying at the graduate level. The student-faculty ratio is very low, at 3:1. More than one-fourth of Caltech's total enrollment is international. The school’s academic calendar is based on the quarter system and English is the language of instruction.Caltech has six academic divisions, many of which have highly ranked graduate programs: biology and biological engineering; chemistry and chemical engineering; engineering and applied science; geology and planetary sciences; humanities and social sciences; and physics, mathematics and astronomy. The university guarantees housing for all first-year undergraduate and graduate students. Instead of typical undergraduate residence halls like those found at many U.S. universities, there are eight undergraduate houses, each with its own government and special traditions. Newly admitted graduate students are given priority for housing in the on-campus Catalina Apartments.Around 80 percent of undergraduates participate in research during their time at Caltech. The university offers a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships program where students write research proposals, collaborate with mentors and give presentations on their projects. Caltech has around 50 research institutes and centers, such as the Resnick Sustainability Institute and the Tectonics Observatory. Additionally, the university operates NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a center for robotic exploration of the solar system that engages both faculty and students.",

    "summary": "The University of British Columbia is a public institution located in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The university was established in 1908 and opened in 1915. It has two main campuses – the Vancouver campus and the Okanagan campus located in Kelowna. The Vancouver campus is the larger of the two, accommodating more than 85 percent of UBC students. In a recent year, 23 percent of students at the Vancouver campus and around 13 percent at the Okanagan campus were international. Tuition costs at UBC vary by degree program and are higher for international students. University housing is guaranteed for first-year UBC undergraduates, and newly admitted international students who are second-year undergrads receive housing priority too. Housing is also available for returning undergraduate and graduate students.The Vancouver campus offers more than two dozen academic divisions, while the Okanagan campus has eight. The academic calendars for both campuses include two-term winter and summer sessions, although the summer session is optional. The primary language of instruction at UBC is English. First-year international students can opt to enroll in the Vantage One program at UBC's Vantage College, which aims to help students improve their English, in part by stretching their first year of study from eight to 11 months. Following completion, students transition into the second year of their UBC degree program. Examples of UBC research facilities include Canada’s national TRIUMF subatomic physics laboratory, the Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at UBC Farm and the Institute for Healthy Living and Chronic Disease Prevention.",

The university has three main campuses: the St Lucia campus, where the large majority of students study; the Gatton campus, the university’s hub for agriculture and veterinary science; and the Herston campus, which houses the school’s clinical health facilities. Other University of Queensland sites – including marine research stations, teaching hospitals and an underground mine – are located around Queensland. Tuition costs vary by subject and are higher for international students. University student housing is available at both the St Lucia and Gatton campuses.The university has six main academic divisions: business, economics and law; engineering, architecture and information technology; health and behavioral sciences; humanities and social sciences; medicine and biomedical sciences; and science. English is the language of instruction at the University of Queensland,and the university follows a semester-based academic calendar. Some courses are also offered during a shorter summer semester. As is the case at manyAustralian universities, bachelor’s students can earn an honors degree by completing an additional year or two of study, focused heavily on research. The university’s research facilities include the Institute for Molecular Bioscience, the Queensland Brain Institute and the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology. Undergraduate students can receive scholarships to participate in research during summer and winter breaks via university research programs.",

    "summary": "McGill University is a public institution that was founded in 1821 and is located in Quebec, Canada. The university has two campuses: the downtown campus in Montreal and the Macdonald campus in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue. The two campuses are approximately 20 miles apart. The primary language of instruction is English, although in a recent year around 20 percent of university students said French was their mother tongue. In fact, around half of the population of Montreal speaks French as a first language. Around one-fourth of the student body is international, with students hailing from more than 150 countries. University housing is available for undergraduate and graduate students on both campuses.The university is made up of 10 faculties and schools – agricultural and environmental sciences, arts, dentistry, education, engineering, law, management, medicine, music and science – that offer around 300 programs of study. Around two-thirds of the university's students study at the undergraduate level. Tuition costs are higher for international students, and McGill's academic calendar is based on a semester system. The university is affiliated with multiple teaching hospitals, and its medical school is the oldest in Canada. Research at the university takes place at more than 40 McGill research centers – such as the McGill Centre for Bioinformatics, the Centre on Population Dynamics and the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy – and at other affiliated institutes and hospitals. The creation of the first artificial blood cell is among the research achievements associated with the university.",

    "summary": "The Free University of Berlin is a public institution that was founded in 1948. The university has three main campuses in Berlin. Additionally, Free University andHumboldt-Universität zu Berlinjointly operate theCharite – Medical University of Berlin, which enrolls students affiliated with both universities. In a recent year, roughly 16 percent of the Free University student body was pursuing doctoral degrees. Students do not pay tuition for most degree programs, which is generally the case at public universities in Germany. Student housing is available, though the accommodations are not located on campus and are managed by outside organizations that have agreements with the university.The university has 11 academic departments, the joint medical school as well as three central institutes that offer degrees in Eastern European, Latin American and North American studies. In all, Free University offers some 180 bachelor's and master's degree programs as well as around 50 doctoral programs. The university’s academic calendar is semester-based, with courses beginning in October and April. The primary language of instruction is German, though the university offers some English-taught programs, most of which are at the master's level. The English-taught master's offerings include programs in computational sciences, international health and North American studies. Around 600 international scholars and scientists come to the university each year to serve in teaching and research roles. Among the university’s interdisciplinary research focus areas are plant sciences, functional materials at the nanoscale and disease in human aging.",

    "summary": "The University of California—Santa Barbara, or UCSB, is a public university that traces its roots back to 1891. The school became part of the University of California system in 1944. The West Coast university's campus overlooks the Pacific Ocean and is about 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles. In a recent year, the institution enrolled more than 20,000 students, and upward of 85 percent of them were studying at the undergraduate level. Top countries of origin for UCSB's international students that year included China, India and South Korea. Non-California residents pay a supplemental tuition at UCSB. University housing is available and guaranteed for four years for new freshmen undergrads and for two years for transfer students.UCSB has five colleges and schools – creative studies, engineering, letters and science, environmental science and management, and education – as well as a graduate division. In all, the institution offers more than 200 majors, degrees and credentials. The university follows a quarter-based academic calendar, and English is the primary language of instruction. UCSB has around a dozen national research institutes and centers on its campus, including the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies, which the U.S. Army supports. More than 50 percent of the university's undergraduate students conduct research, some through programs such as the Faculty Research Assistance Program, which pairs students with UCSB researchers in their fields of interest and allows them to earn credit for their work.",

    "summary": "Sapienza University of Rome is a public institution that was founded in 1303 by Pope Boniface VIII. The Italian university was originally called the Studium Urbis but became known as Sapienza in 1660. Its main campus, known as Città Universitaria, is located near the Rome city center.The institution also has facilities in different parts of Rome and the greater Lazio region. More than 110,000 students attended Sapienza University in a recent year. The cost of tuition varies by academic subject, and some university-affiliated student housing is available.The university has 11 academic divisions: architecture; arts and humanities; civil and industrial engineering; economics; information engineering, informatics and statistics; law; mathematics, physics and natural sciences; medicine and dentistry; medicine and psychology; pharmacy and medicine; and political science, sociology and communication science. There is also a school of aerospace engineering. Sapienza uses a semester-based academic calendar, with courses beginning in September and February.Almost all of the university's undergraduate programs are taught in Italian, though there are a few English-taught master's programs. International joint degree programs – offered in conjunction with other universities – are also available, giving Sapienza students the opportunity to study in Rome and abroad. Sapienza's research facilities include centers focused on transport and logistics as well as cyber intelligence and information security. The university’s other academic resources include nearly 60 libraries and a network of 20 museums, including a herbarium and a museum of classical art.",

    "summary": "The University of Milan is a public institution that was founded in 1924. The Italian university’s main campus is situated in a historical complex called Ca’ Granda in the Milan city center. Additional facilities are in the university quarter, or Città Studi, and in a few other locations both in and outside Milan. Tuition costs are the same for Italian and international students but vary based on field of study. A limited amount of university student housing is available for students who come from outside the Milan area.The institution offers studies in a variety of academic areas: agricultural and food sciences; exercise and sports sciences; humanities; law; linguistic and cultural mediation sciences; medicine; pharmacy; political, economic and social sciences; science and technology; and veterinary medicine. In all, the university offers around 65 bachelor's programs and a similar number of master's programs. The university’s academic calendar is semester-based, though all departments may not have the same start and end dates for their courses. Italian is the primary language of instruction, but the university does offer some English-taught degree programs, most of which are at the graduate level. Examples of programs taught in English include master's programs in economics and finance as well as sustainable development. Research centers at the university include the Centre for Gender & Equality in Research and Science and the Centre of Excellence on Neurodegenerative Diseases. The university also has three botanical gardens, one dating back to 1777, that are used for education and research activities.",

In addition to facilities located in different areas of Uppsala, the university has a campus located on the Swedish island of Gotland. Some programs only available at the Gotland campus are conservation as well as game design. Students from European Union and European Economic Area countries and Switzerland do not pay tuition. But international students from outside these areas are charged tuition, which varies by academic discipline, with medical, science and technology-related studies costing more. The university does not provide housing, except to exchange students and tuition-paying master’s students. Outside housing organizations manage the residences for the school.The university offers studies in the humanities and social sciences, medical and pharmaceutical, and science and technology disciplines. The school’s academic calendar is semester-based. The university’s medical programs are affiliated with Uppsala University Hospital, where clinical training and research take place. The primary language of instruction is Swedish for undergraduate programs, but a number of both Swedish- and English-taught master's programs are available. All of the university's international master's offerings are English-taught, including programs in computer science, entrepreneurship, and peace and conflict studies. The university has many research centers, including the Uppsala Centre for Russian and Eurasian Studies, the Centre for Natural Disaster Science and the Uppsala RNA Research Center.",

    "summary": "The University of Bonn is a public institution that was founded in 1818. The university has facilities located throughout Bonn, a city in western Germany near the Rhine River. The city was the birthplace of the late composer Ludwig van Beethoven, and today is home to several United Nations organizations. In a recent year, more than 30,000 students were enrolled at the university and around 12 percent of the total student body was international, with students hailing from around 135 countries. The University of Bonn generally does not charge students for tuition, though students do pay a relatively low social fee each semester. This fee covers a public transportation pass, library access and other student services. Some student housing is available through the public organization Studierendenwerk Bonn.The university has seven main academic divisions – agriculture, arts, Catholic theology, law and economics, mathematics and natural sciences, medicine and Protestant theology – and follows a semester-based academic calendar. German is the primary language of instruction, though some English-taught or bilingual degree programs are available, mostly at the graduate level. Some of the English-taught master's options include programs in computer sciences, economics and mathematics. The university also offers language courses to help international students learn everyday German. Research bodies at the university include the Laboratory for Experimental Economics, the Bethe Center for Theoretical Physics and the Franz Joseph Dölger-Institut, focused on the study of late antiquity. The university has established partnerships with more than 70 global universities, including theUniversity of Tokyo, theAustralian National Universityand theWageningen University and Research Centerin the Netherlands.",

    "summary": "The University of Gothenburg is a public institution that was founded in 1954, although the roots of one of its predecessor schools go back as far as 1891. The university has facilities located throughout Gothenburg, Sweden, one of the Scandinavian country's largest cities. Students from non-European Union and non-European Economic Area countries pay tuition, while those from EU and EEA countries are exempt. In a recent year, the university's international students hailed from around 70 countries. The school only offers student housing to exchange students, but other students can apply for housing through outside organizations such as SGS Studentbostäder, a nonprofit.The university, which follows a semester-based academic calendar, has eight main academic divisions: science; arts; fine, applied and performing arts; social sciences; business, economics and law; education; information technology; and the Sahlgrenska Academy, which is focused on health sciences. The university engages in various collaborations with the nearbyChalmers University of Technology, including three shared academic departments and an agreement that enables master's students at one school to enroll in courses at the other. The primary language of instruction for undergraduate programs is Swedish, though a number of undergraduate and master's courses are taught in English. Fully English-taught degree programs, mostly at the graduate level, are also offered. International students can get a taste of the local language by enrolling in free Swedish courses at the university. Some of the university's research facilities include a herbarium, the Sven Lovén Centre for Marine Infrastructure and the Swedish NMR Centre, which is focused on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.",

    "summary": "The University of Montreal is a public institution that traces its roots back to 1878. Initially a branch of the Université Laval de Québec, it became an independent institution in 1919. The university is affiliated with two other schools: Polytechnique Montréal, an engineering school, and HEC Montréal, a business school. The university and its affiliated schools are located in Montreal, Quebec – one of the most populous metropolitan areas in Canada. Around one-fourth of the student body across all three institutions studies at the graduate level. The university offers housing for full-time undergraduate and graduate students.UdeM, as the school is sometimes called, has more than a dozen academic divisions that span the social, natural and health sciences, as well as arts and humanities disciplines. The primary language of instruction is French, although several graduate programs – such as doctoral programs in biochemistry, neurosciences and pharmacology – accept English-speaking students. Tutoring, workshops and other resources are available for students who want to improve their French language skills. The university’s academic calendar is based on a semester system, and tuition costs are higher for international students. The Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, the Cyberjustice Laboratory and the International Centre for Comparative Criminology are among the university’s many research units. Some University of Montreal researchers collaborate on projects with institutions located in other parts of the world, primarily in France, Germany, Italy, the U.K. and the U.S.",

    "summary": "The University of Waterloo is a public institution that was founded in 1957. The Canadian university's main campus is in Waterloo, Ontario, not far from several of the Great Lakes and the U.S. border. The university also has satellite campuses in nearby Cambridge, Kitchener and Stratford. More than 30,000 students attend the university. Tuition is generally higher for international students, though a handful of graduate programs charge domestic and international students the same rate. University housing is available for both undergraduate and graduate students.The university has six main academic divisions: applied health sciences, arts, engineering, environment, math and science. The main campus has four affiliated university colleges – Conrad Grebel University College, Renison University College, St. Jerome’s University and St. Paul's University College – where students can pursue a Waterloo degree in a smaller academic community. The language of instruction is English, and the university's academic calendar consists of three terms. Many of the university's students participate in a co-op program that allows them to alternate academic terms with terms spent in in the workforce. More than 120 of Waterloo's undergraduate programs offer a co-op option. The university also offers joint degree programs with global universities in several countries, including China'sTsinghua University, Taiwan'sNational Chiao Tung Universityand the U.K.'sUniversity of Warwick. A sampling of the university's research institutions includes the Water Institute, the Waterloo Centre for Automotive Research and the Mike & Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre.",

    "summary": "Yonsei University is a private institution that traces its roots back to 1885, when Christian missionaries founded a hospital that eventually became part of the university. The university as it currently exists was created in 1957. The South Korean school has multiple campuses, with the Sinchon campus in Seoul as its main location. Other locations include the International Campus in Songdo, which opened in 2010, and the Wonju Campus. Tuition costs at Yonsei are the same for domestic and international students and vary by academic subject. University housing is available for both undergraduate and graduate students. Yonsei freshmen spend their first year on the International Campus and participate in the university's residential college system, in which students become members of one of 12 houses that offer educational and social activities.The university has numerous academic divisions, including colleges of liberal arts, business and economics, science, engineering and theology, among others. The primary language of instruction at Yonsei is Korean, but some English-taught degree programs are offered. For instance, programs at the university’s Underwood International College, a liberal arts institution, are entirely English-taught, as are the programs at the Graduate School of International Studies. Another English-taught offering is the Yonsei Global MBA program. The university has a semester-based academic calendar. University research institutes include the Institute of Convergence Science, the Institute for Poverty Alleviation and International Development and the Institute of Korean Studies.",

    "summary": "The University of Vienna is a public institution that was founded in 1365, making it the oldest university in the German-speaking world. The Austrian university is located in Vienna, the country's capital. The school does not have one central campus but instead has facilities located throughout the city, primarily in the first and ninth districts. Students pay relatively low tuition each semester as well as a small student union fee. The tuition costs are higher for some students from outside the European Union and European Economic Area. The University of Vienna does not operate its own student housing.The university has numerous academic divisions, including those focused on business, economics and statistics; computer science; historical and cultural studies; psychology; and life sciences. Additionally, the university has centers focused on translation studies, sport science, molecular biology and teacher education. In all, the University of Vienna offers around 175 degree programs, including several joint degree programs that provide students the opportunity to study at more than one university. The university follows a semester-based academic calendar, and the primary language of instruction is German. However, a handful of degree programs are taught in English, including master’s programs in communication science, economics and computer science. One of the university's research centers is the Vienna Center for Quantum Science and Technology, which is jointly operated with theVienna University of Technologyand the Austrian Academy of Sciences.",

    "summary": "Pompeu Fabra University, also known as UPF, is a public institution that was founded in 1990. It is located in Barcelona, Spain, and has three campuses – the Cituadella, Poblenou and Mar campuses – located near one another in the heart of the city. The university’s namesake, Pompeu Fabra, is credited with standardizing the modern Catalan language during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In a recent year, more than 13,000 students attended the university. Some student housing is available near the school's campuses, though UPF does not manage it directly.UPF has three broad academic focus areas: social sciences and humanities, health and life sciences, and communications and information technologies. The university is also affiliated with the UPF Group, a collection of specialized teaching and research institutions, including the UPF Barcelona School of Management, the Elisava School of Design and the Mar Nursing School. UPF follows a trimester-based academic calendar. In a recent year, around 20 percent of the UPF faculty was international. Three languages are spoken in UPF classrooms: Catalan, Spanish and English. The primary language of instruction for undergraduates is Catalan, though some subjects are taught in English. Additionally, some graduate-level programs are taught entirely in English, including master's programs in political philosophy and biomedical research.The university has numerous research groups, including groups focused on human genetics research, political behavior and wireless communications. UPF is also affiliated with several research centers that are UPF Group members, including the Centre for Regenerative Medicine in Barcelona and the Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute.",
